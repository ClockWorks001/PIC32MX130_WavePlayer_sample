# WAVE Player PIC32MX130F sample Project.
---
## Description

This is a sample project for WAVE Playter with [PIC32MX130 micro controller][2] with [MPLAB.X][3] [MCC][4].
I have created this sample project using Mr.ChaN's wonderful FatFs program. 
You can operat it by terminal with serial communication speed of 115,200 bps.

## Prerequisites

I created this project using the free versions of the following tools:
 * [FatFs][1] (R0.12b)
 * [Microchip MPLAB X][3] (v3.5)
 * [Microchip MPLAB X Code Configurator][4] (v3.26)
 * [Microchip XC32 Compiler][5] (v1.42)
 * [KiCad][6] (v4.0.1)

You shoud download and install these tools appropriately before you will open this project and build it.
I use the [Microchip MPLAB PICkit3 In-Circuit Debugger][7] to program the chip and debug it.  

Also, I use the [KiCad][6] to draw the electric circuit schematic.
